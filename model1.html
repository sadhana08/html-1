	<h1>Naruto uzumaki</h1>
	<p><big>Naruto Uzumaki <b>(うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto)</b> is a shinobi of Konohagakure's <bold>Uzumaki clan</bold>. He became the jinchūriki of the <strong>Nine-Tails</strong> on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining <big><b>Team Kakashi</b></big>, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.</big></p>
